// here this navigator function is a in-build function of a browser that give us the current location of the user and it takes one function as a argument to handle what to do after fetching the location here we are sorting the places according to the use distance fom each and every places
  // it's returning an position object (you can change name if you want) that contains the longitude and latitude of the use location which help us to calculate the distance
  // but this function is a side effect because this code needed by the application but it's not directly related to the task the main goal of the component function because the main application of any main component is to return a render-able JSX code
  // let's try it to handle with the use state for that we created a new state up there
  // but this will drag us to the infinite execution of the app component because every time anything changes and app component re render it will recalculate the use distance again and go through the same process again and this loop will not stop
  // so overcome this problem we will now use useEffect Hook
  // navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position)=>{
  //   const sortedPlaces = sortPlacesByDistance(AVAILABLE_PLACES , position.coords.latitude ,position.coords.longitude);

  //   setavailablePlaces(sortedPlaces);
  // })

  // now after using this the infinite loop of recalculating the distance will be gone
  // it takes two arguments 1] is a function that will contain you side effect code   2] second is an array of dependencies
  // very important ::  this function will be executed by react after every component execution
  // what means to say is that when this component executes this function will not execute immediately but it will execute after the jsx code is executed and than this side effect will execute the function 
  // the dependency array will decide how many times this and when this useEffect will be executed
  // If you define this dependency array than react will take a look at the dependencies specified there and it will only execute this effect function again if the dependencies values changed , is we make it empty the react will only execute this effect once  
  // here if you not include the array of second argument than this side effect will be execute after avery re-execution of the component
